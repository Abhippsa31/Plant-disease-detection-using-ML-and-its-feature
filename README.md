# 🌿 Plant Disease Detection Using Machine Learning

This project aims to detect plant diseases and predict nutrient deficiencies using machine learning and computer vision techniques. The solution uses deep learning models to classify plant leaf images and integrates weather data to improve prediction accuracy.

## 🔍 Features

- **Disease Classification:** Using CNN for detecting diseases from leaf images.
- **Nutrient Deficiency Detection:** Identifies deficiencies like Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium through leaf texture and color.
- **Spot and Vein Pattern Detection:** Applies image processing techniques (edge detection, pattern recognition).
- **Weather-Aware Analysis:** Integrates temperature, humidity, and rainfall data for context-aware disease prediction.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- OpenCV  
- Scikit-learn  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap)
