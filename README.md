# ðŸŒ¿ Plant Disease Detection Using Machine Learning

This project provides an intelligent solution for detecting plant diseases and predicting nutrient deficiencies using deep learning, computer vision, and environmental data. It is built using a modular structure, with separate components for disease classification, nutrient analysis, spot detection, and weather integration.
